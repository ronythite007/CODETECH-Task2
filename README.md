# Overview Of Project 
## Project : NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) APPLICATION
This project involves developing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application to analyze and process text data. The application utilizes various NLP techniques for text preprocessing and implements advanced NLP models for deeper text analysis and representation.

## Objective
Objective: To build an NLP application that preprocesses text data and employs advanced NLP models for analysis and representation.
## Key Activities
### Text Preprocessing:

#### Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
#### Stemming: Reducing words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" to "run").
#### Lemmatization: Converting words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., "better" to "good").
#### Stop-word Removal: Removing common words that do not contribute significant meaning (e.g., "the", "and").
### Advanced NLP Models:

#### Word Embeddings: Implementing models such as Word2Vec and GloVe to create dense vector representations of words, capturing semantic meanings and relationships.
## Technology Used
### Programming Language: Python
### Libraries:
nltk for text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop-word removal)
gensim for Word2Vec model implementation
spacy for advanced text processing and lemmatization
scikit-learn for additional machine learning tasks and model evaluation
##Conclusion
This project showcases the development of an NLP application that effectively preprocesses text data and leverages advanced models for text analysis. The techniques and models used in this application form the foundation for more complex NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and named entity recognition. This project serves as a robust starting point for exploring and implementing various NLP methodologies.
